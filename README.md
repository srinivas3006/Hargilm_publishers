## 🌟 Key Features & Portals

The application is structured into interconnected portals, featuring strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure maximum security.

### 📖 The Book Store (Public & Readers)
A beautifully designed, fast, and SEO-optimized storefront for book discovery and purchasing.
- **Advanced SEO (JSON-LD):** Implements professional-grade Schema.org structured data, canonical URLs, and dynamic sitemaps so Google can display Rich Snippets for books and author profiles.
- **Dynamic Catalog:** Browse books with advanced filtering by category, format, and price (`/books`).
- **Seamless Checkout Pipeline:** State-managed shopping cart ready for payment gateway integration (`/checkout/*`).
- **Reader Dashboard:** A secure space for users to track orders, manage their digital library, and save wishlists (`/dashboard/*`).

### ✍️ The Author Ecosystem
A dedicated workspace designed to empower writers, protected by the `Author` role.
- **Manuscript Portal:** Submit and track the status of new manuscripts (`/author/manuscripts/new`). Upon admin approval, readers are automatically upgraded to authors!
- **Analytics & Royalties:** Dashboards tracking sales performance and royalty payouts (`/author/analytics`).
- **Portfolio Management:** Manage published titles and update author profiles (`/author/books`).

### ⚙️ The Admin Command Center
A powerful, entirely secured CMS portal for platform administrators (`/admin`).
- **Inventory CMS:** Add, edit, and categorize the global book inventory using Cloudinary-ready `multipart/form-data` forms (`/admin/books/new`).
- **Order Fulfillment:** Track platform-wide physical orders and transition their statuses from Processing to Shipped to Delivered (`/admin/orders`).
- **User Role Management:** Instantly promote standard Readers to Authors or grant Admin privileges through the visual dashboard (`/admin/users`).
- **Strict Security:** Enforced by Next.js middleware and `AuthGuard` components to prevent unauthorized access.
