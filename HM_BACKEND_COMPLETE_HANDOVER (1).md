# HM Backend Complete Frontend/API Handover

**Generated:** 2026-08-09  
**Revision:** 1.1  
**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE FRONTEND INTEGRATION CONTRACT  
**Supersedes:** Initial handover revision  
**Security hotfix:** Public registration role escalation blocked on 2026-08-10  
**Repository:** `C:/Users/user/hm_backend`  
**Branch:** `main`  
**HEAD:** `6d437ad4cde316f1a00e7d5e2b911b45a359c053`  
**Canonical human-readable handover:** `docs/HM_BACKEND_COMPLETE_HANDOVER.md`

This document is the single canonical integration guide for frontend, admin-panel, QA, deployment, and future engineering work. It was prepared from actual runtime routing, `src/docs/apiInventory.js`, generated OpenAPI, Postman artifacts, existing docs, and certification notes. Runtime code was not changed for this document.

## Revision 1.1 Changes

Revision 1.1 removes the temporary payload pause after verifying every previously paused write contract against runtime code, route inventory, generated OpenAPI, and request schemas.

- Public registration role escalation is blocked: public register always creates `reader`.
- `Book.mrp` is documented as the canonical book price; legacy `price` is only a synchronized compatibility alias.
- Author book and admin book write contracts are separated.
- All 6 multipart upload APIs declare the correct `multipart/form-data` payload schemas.
- Author access plan, grant, revoke, and restore payloads are explicit.
- Author book submission, editorial actions, and royalty settlement payloads are complete.
- Critical frontend response contracts, state naming, F1-F21 implementation guidance, and screen-to-API matrix are authoritative.
- Documentation validation now proves route coverage, write contract coverage, multipart schema coverage, request schema integrity, public register role removal, and MRP canonical wording.

## Security Hotfix: Public Registration Contract

Public registration always creates a `reader` account. Frontend clients must not send a `role` field to `POST /api/auth/register`.

```json
{
  "name": "Reader Name",
  "email": "reader@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPass123!"
}
```

Author privileges are granted only after Admin approval of an AuthorApplication. Admin privilege is never available through public registration. If a legacy client sends `role`, the backend strips/ignores it at validation and the service layer still creates `reader`.

## 1. Document Purpose

HM Backend is a production Node.js, Express, MongoDB backend for a publishing and book-commerce platform. It supports public catalog browsing, reader accounts, checkout with manual UPI verification, author applications, author-owned publishing, paid author dashboard access, admin operations, invoices, shipments, notifications, analytics, and royalty settlement accounting.

This guide is for frontend developers, admin-panel developers, mobile developers, QA engineers, backend maintainers, DevOps engineers, and future coding agents. A developer should be able to integrate the platform by reading this file without opening backend source files.

## 2. Backend Completion Status

| Phase | Scope | Status | Frontend impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | Book MRP / pricing | Complete | Use `book.mrp` as canonical display and checkout price. `price` remains compatibility. |
| Phase 2 | Multi-purpose payment | Complete | Payments can be `ORDER_PURCHASE` or `AUTHOR_ACCESS`. Do not assume every payment has an order. |
| Phase 3 | Author approval + paid dashboard | Complete | Author role gives publishing; paid entitlement unlocks dashboard only. |
| Phase 4 | Author publishing workflow | Complete | Authors can create drafts, upload assets, submit for review, and track state. |
| Phase 5 | Author dashboard / royalty analytics | Complete | Entitled authors can view metrics, royalties, and performance. |
| Phase 5.1 | Historical royalty integrity | Complete | Historical orders without snapshots show unknown royalty, not zero. |
| Phase 6A | Royalty settlement / manual payout | Complete | Admin creates settlements and records manual payout. |
| Phase 7 | Admin + frontend contracts | Complete | Admin/user/content compatibility endpoints exist. |
| Phase 8 | Production certification | Complete | Code certification passed; deployment remains conditional on DB migration/audit and secret review. |

Automatic payout provider: **not implemented by design**. Manual payout is the current production business design.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

```text
Frontend / Admin / Mobile
  -> Express routes
  -> middleware: auth, role, upload, validation, security
  -> controller: request orchestration only
  -> service: business rules and transactions
  -> repository: persistence and query shaping
  -> Mongoose models
  -> MongoDB
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  UI[Frontend/Admin/Mobile] --> R[Express Routes]
  R --> M[Middleware]
  M --> C[Controllers]
  C --> S[Services]
  S --> Repo[Repositories]
  Repo --> Models[Mongoose Models]
  Models --> DB[(MongoDB)]
  S --> Bus[Event Bus]
  Bus --> Inv[Invoice Subscriber]
  Bus --> Ship[Shipment Subscriber]
  Bus --> Notif[Notification Subscriber]
  Bus --> Analytics[Analytics Subscriber]
  Bus --> Access[Author Access Subscriber]
```

Events and subscribers decouple side effects. Payment verification can create invoices, shipments, notifications, analytics, and author access effects after successful state changes. Controllers must not call subscribers directly.

## 4. Backend Domain Overview

- Authentication: register, login, refresh, logout, password reset, current user.
- Users: current profile, user context, account orders, invoices, shipments, notifications, wishlist, library.
- Books: catalog, detail, related books, reviews, admin CRUD, author-owned drafts.
- Categories: public category browsing and admin category management.
- Reviews: customer review creation and admin moderation.
- Orders: checkout, payment verification bridge, cancellation, tracking.
- Payments: provider-agnostic payment attempts, manual UPI UTR, admin verification.
- Invoices: generated after verified order payment, downloadable.
- Shipping: shipment records and tracking after order payment/invoice flow.
- Uploads: Cloudinary-backed image and document upload with config checks.
- Author Applications: reader applies; admin approves/rejects; approval promotes user to author.
- Author Access: paid author dashboard entitlement using `AUTHOR_ACCESS` payment purpose.
- Author Books: author-created drafts and editorial submission.
- Publish Requests: legacy/new publishing workflow tied to editorial review.
- Author Dashboard: metrics, analytics, book performance, royalty history.
- Royalty Settlement: admin settlement batches and manual payout recording.
- Admin Operations: operational dashboard, search, payments, inventory, ledgers.
- Content / CMS: global text/content settings for frontend pages.
- Notifications / Analytics: asynchronous projections and user/admin APIs.

## 5. Environment + Base URL

Use placeholders in frontend code and deployment settings. Do not embed secrets in browser code.

| Environment | Base URL |
| --- | --- |
| Local | `http://localhost:<PORT>` |
| Staging | `https://<STAGING_API_DOMAIN>` |
| Production | `https://<YOUR_API_DOMAIN>` |

API routes generally use the `/api` prefix. Exceptions are `GET /` for the developer portal and `GET /health` for liveness. Swagger remains at `/api/docs`; OpenAPI JSON remains at `/api/docs.json`.

## 6. Authentication Overview

| API | Purpose | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/register` | Create account | Public |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | Login | Public |
| `POST /api/auth/refresh` | Refresh access token | Public/Bearer |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | Revoke refresh session | Public/Bearer |
| `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` | Start password reset | Public |
| `PUT /api/auth/reset-password/{token}` | Reset password | Public |
| `POST /api/auth/reset-password/{token}` | Reset password alias | Public |
| `PUT /api/auth/change-password` | Change password | Bearer |
| `POST /api/auth/change-password` | Change password alias | Bearer |
| `GET /api/auth/me` | Current user | Bearer |
| `GET /api/users/me` | Current user profile | Bearer |
| `GET /api/users/me/context` | Frontend bootstrap context | Bearer |

All protected routes use:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

## 7. Authentication Frontend Implementation

```text
Login form
  -> POST /api/auth/login
  -> read data.token and refresh token if returned
  -> store token according to frontend security policy
  -> GET /api/users/me/context
  -> build navigation and permissions from context
```

On `401`, attempt one refresh if a refresh token is available. If refresh fails, clear auth state and send the user to login. Do not keep retrying indefinitely.

## 8. User Roles

Actual role values include `visitor`, `reader`, `author`, and `admin`. Frontend compatibility accepts `user` in admin update requests and normalizes it to `reader` server-side.

| Capability | Reader | Author No Plan | Author ACTIVE | Author REVOKED | Admin |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Public catalog | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Checkout/order | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Author application | Yes | N/A | N/A | N/A | Admin review |
| Book publishing | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Paid dashboard | No | No | Yes | No | Yes/admin inspect |
| Royalty analytics | No | No | Yes | No | Yes/admin inspect |
| Settlement detail | No | No | Own only | No | All |
| Admin APIs | No | No | No | No | Yes |

## 9. User Context / Bootstrap Contract

Use `GET /api/users/me/context` after login and page refresh. This is the frontend bootstrap endpoint for role, author access, and capability hints.

Typical response shape:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "_id": "<USER_ID>",
      "name": "Reader Name",
      "email": "reader@example.com",
      "role": "reader",
      "isActive": true
    },
    "roles": ["reader"],
    "capabilities": {
      "canPublish": false,
      "canAccessAuthorDashboard": false,
      "canAdminister": false
    },
    "authorApplication": null,
    "authorAccess": {
      "state": "NOT_AUTHOR",
      "entitlement": null,
      "activePlan": null,
      "purchase": null
    }
  }
}
```

Frontend capabilities are UX hints. Backend authorization remains authoritative.

## 10. Universal API Conventions

| Convention | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | Use `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` for protected APIs. |
| JSON | Use `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON writes. |
| Multipart | Use `multipart/form-data`; field names are `image` or `document`. |
| IDs | Mongo ObjectId strings. Do not parse into numbers. |
| Timestamps | ISO strings. Render in local UI timezone. |
| Money | Store/display as numeric amount in currency. Frontend must not submit trusted totals. |
| Currency | Currently INR-oriented; use returned `currency` where present. |
| Null | `null` can mean unknown, especially royalty fields. Do not coerce to 0. |
| Pagination | Query `page`, `limit`; responses may include `pages` or `totalPages`. |
| Sorting | Only use documented query params. |
| Filtering | Use endpoint-specific query params in the reference tables. |

## 11. Standard Success Response

Most JSON endpoints return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

Paginated endpoints usually return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 0,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "pages": 0
  }
}
```

Some newer or compatibility endpoints include additional top-level compatibility fields. Frontend should normalize with `response.data ?? response` where needed, but must not ignore `success: false`.

## 12. Standard Error Response

Common shape:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message"
}
```

Some service errors include stable `error` or `code`:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "AUTHOR_DASHBOARD_ACCESS_REQUIRED",
  "message": "Active author dashboard access is required."
}
```

Production responses should not expose stack traces. Development may include `stack` from the global error handler.

## 13. Error Handling Strategy for Frontend

| HTTP | Meaning | Frontend handling |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad request or business validation | Show field/form message. |
| 401 | Missing/invalid auth | Refresh once, then login. |
| 403 | Role, entitlement, or ownership denied | Show permission/paywall state. |
| 404 | Record/route not found | Show empty/not found state. |
| 409 | Duplicate or state conflict | Refresh data and show conflict message. |
| 413 | Upload too large | Show file size message. |
| 415 | Unsupported upload type | Show accepted file types. |
| 422 | Validation failure where used | Map to fields. |
| 500 | Unexpected server error | Generic retry/support. |
| 503 | Dependency unavailable/config missing | Show temporary unavailable/config message. |

## 14. Complete Error Code Reference

Important stable codes and messages are documented here. Do not invent behavior from UI assumptions.

| HTTP | Error Code / Signal | Meaning | Frontend Handling |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | Missing bearer token | User is not authenticated. | Login or refresh. |
| 403 | `AUTHOR_DASHBOARD_ACCESS_REQUIRED` | Author lacks active paid dashboard entitlement. | Show purchase or pending state. |
| 403 | `AUTHOR_DASHBOARD_ACCESS_REVOKED` | Dashboard entitlement revoked. | Lock dashboard and show support/admin message. |
| 403 | Admin authorization failure | User is not admin. | Hide admin UI and show denied. |
| 404 | Route not found | Endpoint path is wrong or not deployed. | Check base URL and path. |
| 404 | Resource not found | Record missing or not accessible. | Show not found/refresh. |
| 409 | Duplicate UTR | UTR already belongs to a payment. | Ask user to verify entry/contact support. |
| 409 | Duplicate settlement claim | Royalty source already settled/claimed. | Refresh settlement preview. |
| 409 | Invalid state transition | Action no longer valid. | Refresh detail page. |
| 413 | Upload limit | File exceeds configured max size. | Compress or choose smaller file. |
| 415 | Invalid MIME | Unsupported file type. | Restrict picker to allowed types. |
| 503 | Upload provider config missing | Cloudinary/env dependency unavailable. | Show temporary unavailable. |

## 15. Pagination Contract

Use `page=1&limit=20` unless a screen needs a smaller limit. Backend responses may use `pages` or `totalPages`; support both.

```json
{
  "pagination": {
    "total": 125,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "pages": 7
  }
}
```

## 16. Search, Sort and Filters

The complete endpoint reference below lists query params. Common filters include `page`, `limit`, `search`, `q`, `status`, `from`, `to`, `role`, `category`, `bookId`, `authorId`, `paymentId`, and `orderId`. Only use parameters listed for that endpoint.

## 17. Customer Frontend Architecture

```text
Home -> Catalog -> Book Detail -> Cart -> Checkout -> Payment QR -> UTR Submit -> Orders -> Invoice/Tracking -> Profile
```

Use `GET /api/content` for CMS text, `GET /api/books` and `GET /api/categories` for catalog, and authenticated user APIs for account pages.

## 18. Catalog APIs

Important public catalog endpoints:

| API | Purpose | Frontend usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/content` | Global CMS content | Home/publish/about/footer/settings. |
| `GET /api/books` | Catalog list | Listing, filters, featured rows. |
| `GET /api/books/{slug}` | Book detail | Product detail page. |
| `GET /api/books/{slug}/related` | Related books | Detail recommendations. |
| `GET /api/books/{slug}/reviews` | Reviews | Detail reviews section. |
| `GET /api/categories` | Category list | Navigation/filter menus. |
| `GET /api/categories/{slug}` | Category detail | Category landing page. |
| `GET /api/categories/{slug}/books` | Books in category | Category listing. |
| `GET /api/search?q=query` | Search | Global search results. |
| `GET /api/authors` | Public authors | Author listing. |
| `GET /api/authors/{id}` | Author profile | Public author page. |
| `GET /api/authors/{id}/books` | Author books | Public author catalog. |

## 19. Book Object

| Field | Type | Nullable | Description | Frontend Usage |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `_id` | string | No | Book ObjectId | Internal links/cart payload. |
| `title` | string | No | Book title | Display. |
| `slug` | string | No | SEO route key | URL path. |
| `description` | string | Maybe | Long text | Detail page. |
| `author` | object/string | Maybe | Author data or ID | Display/links. |
| `category` | object/string | Maybe | Category data or ID | Display/filter. |
| `mrp` | number | No | Canonical selling price | Preferred display/checkout basis. |
| `price` | number | No | Legacy compatibility alias | Fallback only. |
| `royaltyPercentage` | number | Admin only | Royalty policy | Admin forms only. |
| `coverImage` | string | Maybe | Image URL | Product image. |
| `stock` | number | Maybe | Available stock | Availability UI. |
| `reservedStock` | number | Admin only | Reserved units | Admin inventory. |
| `status` | string | No | draft/published/archived | Public should show published only. |
| `ratings` | number | Maybe | Average rating | Display. |
| `reviewCount` | number | Maybe | Review count | Display. |
| `createdAt` | string | No | ISO timestamp | Sorting/display. |

`mrp` is canonical. `price` remains for older frontend contracts.

## 20. Book Listing Frontend Implementation

Request example:

```http
GET /api/books?page=1&limit=12&category=fiction&minPrice=0&maxPrice=1000&sort=-createdAt
```

Show loading skeletons, handle empty results, reset page to 1 on filter/search changes, and prefer `mrp` for price display.

## 21. Book Detail Frontend Implementation

Route by slug. Load book first, then related books and reviews. If book is missing, show not-found. Do not send the displayed price to checkout; send only `book` ID and `quantity`.

## 22. Cart Strategy

The frontend cart may store `bookId`, `slug`, `title`, `coverImage`, `quantity`, and display-only `mrp`. All financial totals are recalculated by the backend at order creation.

## 23. Checkout API

`POST /api/orders`

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "book": "<BOOK_ID>", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "shippingAddress": {
    "fullName": "Reader Name",
    "addressLine1": "Street 1",
    "addressLine2": "Apartment",
    "city": "Chennai",
    "postalCode": "600001",
    "country": "IN"
  },
  "paymentMethod": "UPI"
}
```

Required fields: `items`, `items[].book`, `items[].quantity`, `shippingAddress.fullName`, `addressLine1`, `city`, `postalCode`, `country`. `paymentMethod` defaults to `UPI`.

## 24. Fields Frontend Must Never Control

Never send trusted values for price, MRP, subtotal, tax, shipping, total, payment amount, payment purpose, royalty percentage, settlement payout amount, invoice number, shipment status, inventory quantity, order paid state, or admin-only book flags.

## 25. Checkout Calculation

Current checkout uses server-side `Book.mrp * quantity`. Current book checkout tax is `0`. Shipping rules remain server-owned and must be read from the created order response. The frontend should display backend-returned `subtotal`, `tax`, `shippingPrice`, and `totalPrice`.

## 26. Customer Payment Flow

```text
POST /api/orders
  -> creates order
  -> creates ORDER_PURCHASE payment intent
  -> generates UPI QR metadata
  -> customer pays externally
  -> PUT /api/orders/{id}/verify-payment with UTR
  -> admin verifies payment
  -> payment verified
  -> order compatibility fields sync
  -> invoice/shipment/notification/analytics run asynchronously
```

## 27. Customer Payment APIs

| API | Purpose | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/orders` | Create order and payment intent | `OrderCreateRequest` |
| `PUT /api/orders/{id}/verify-payment` | Submit UTR for order payment | `{ "utr": "UTR123456789" }` |
| `GET /api/users/{id}/orders/{orderId}/payments` | List payment attempts | Query `page`, `limit` |
| `GET /api/users/{id}/payments` | List all user payment attempts | Query `status`, `order`, `page`, `limit` |
| `GET /api/users/{id}/payments/{paymentId}` | Payment detail | No body |

## 28. Customer Payment State Machine

| Backend status | Frontend state | UI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INTENT_CREATED`, `QR_GENERATED` | `PAYMENT_PENDING` | Show QR, amount, UTR form. |
| `PAYMENT_SUBMITTED`, `VERIFICATION_PENDING` | `VERIFICATION_PENDING` | Disable UTR form, show waiting. |
| `PAYMENT_VERIFIED` | `PAID` | Show success/order tracking. |
| `PAYMENT_REJECTED`, `PAYMENT_FAILED` | `FAILED` | Show retry/support guidance. |
| `PAYMENT_EXPIRED` | `EXPIRED` | Show expired state. |
| `PAYMENT_CANCELLED` | `CANCELLED` | Show cancelled state. |

## 29. Payment Frontend UI Handling

Disable submit buttons while requests are in flight. After UTR submission, refresh order/payment detail. For rejected/expired payments, do not reuse old UTR. For verified payment, use returned order/payment state rather than local optimistic state.

## 30. UTR Submission

UTR payload:

```json
{ "utr": "UTR123456789" }
```

Validation pattern from OpenAPI: `^[A-Z0-9-]{6,64}$`. Convert input to uppercase client-side for UX if desired, but let backend validate. Never log full UTR in browser analytics.

## 31. Orders

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/users/{id}/orders` | User order list |
| `GET /api/orders/{id}` | User order detail |
| `DELETE /api/orders/{id}` | Cancel order where allowed |
| `GET /api/orders/track/{orderNumber}` | Public order tracking by order number |
| `GET /api/orders/{id}/shipment` | Authenticated shipment detail |
| `GET /api/orders/{id}/tracking` | Authenticated tracking timeline |

## 32. Order State Machine

Common frontend mapping: `PENDING` -> created/payment pending, `PROCESSING` -> preparing, `SHIPPED` -> in transit, `DELIVERED` -> completed, `CANCELLED` -> cancelled. Admin compatibility accepts title-case `Processing`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`, `Cancelled` and service normalizes to uppercase.

## 33. Invoice Integration

Invoices are generated only after successful `ORDER_PURCHASE` payment verification. `AUTHOR_ACCESS` payments do not create order invoices.

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/users/{id}/invoices` | Customer invoice list |
| `GET /api/users/{id}/invoices/{invoiceId}` | Invoice detail |
| `GET /api/users/{id}/invoices/{invoiceId}/download` | Download invoice document |
| `GET /api/admin/invoices` | Admin invoice list |
| `GET /api/admin/invoices/search` | Admin invoice search |
| `GET /api/admin/invoices/{id}` | Admin invoice detail |
| `GET /api/admin/invoices/{id}/download` | Admin invoice download |

## 34. Shipment + Tracking

Shipments are tied to order purchase flow and are exposed through user and admin APIs. Admin can assign courier, update status, and cancel shipment. Customer can view own shipments and order tracking.

## 35. Become an Author Flow

```text
Reader
  -> POST /api/author-applications
  -> pending
  -> Admin approves
  -> User role becomes author
  -> Author can publish books
```

## 36. Author Application APIs

| API | Purpose | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/author-applications` | Submit application | `AuthorApplicationRequest` |
| `GET /api/users/me/author-application` | Check current application | No body |
| `GET /api/admin/author-applications?status=pending` | Admin list | Query `status` |
| `PUT /api/admin/author-applications/{id}/status` | Admin approve/reject | `{ "status": "approved" }` or `rejected` |

Application payload:

```json
{
  "penName": "Optional Pen Name",
  "bio": "Short biography",
  "portfolioUrl": "https://example.com",
  "experience": "Writing background"
}
```

## 37. Author Application States

| State | UI |
| --- | --- |
| No application / 404 | Show application form. |
| `pending` | Show pending review. |
| `approved` | Show author publishing navigation. |
| `rejected` | Show rejected state and support/reapply guidance. |

## 38. Permanent Author Permission Rule

**Author role equals publishing access. Paid author dashboard equals dashboard access only.** A revoked or unpaid dashboard plan must not block author book publishing.

## 39. Author Publishing Architecture

| `POST /api/authors/me/books` | Create draft | Uses author-safe book fields. |
| `GET /api/authors/me/books/{bookId}` | Own book detail | Ownership enforced. |
| `PUT /api/authors/me/books/{bookId}` | Update draft | Admin-only fields blocked for authors. |
| `DELETE /api/authors/me/books/{bookId}` | Delete/archive own draft | Ownership/state enforced. |
| `POST /api/authors/me/books/{bookId}/submit` | Submit for review | Creates/updates publishing review flow. |

## 41. Author Book Create Payload

```json

  "title": "My Book",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "category": "<CATEGORY_ID>",
  "mrp": 499,
  "format": "paperback",
  "coverImage": "https://example.com/cover.jpg",
  "isbn": "9780000000000",
  "pages": 240
}
```

## 42. Author Book Field Permission Matrix

| ratings/reviewCount | No | No | System/Admin | Read |
| featured/bestseller/newRelease | No | No | Yes | Read |
| slug | No | No | System/Admin | URL read |

## 43. Author Upload APIs

| API | Field | Auth | Types |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/authors/me/uploads/image` | `image` | Author/Admin | jpeg, png, webp, gif |
| `POST /api/authors/me/uploads/document` | `document` | Author/Admin | pdf, doc, docx |
| `POST /api/uploads/publishing-image` | `image` | Author/Admin | jpeg, png, webp, gif |
| `POST /api/uploads/publishing-document` | `document` | Author/Admin | pdf, doc, docx |

Default max size is 25MB unless `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` is configured. Missing Cloudinary configuration should return a graceful config/dependency error.

## 44. Upload Frontend Example

```ts
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('image', file);
await api.post('/api/authors/me/uploads/image', formData, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

Do not manually set multipart boundary; browser/HTTP client should set it.

## 45. Publishing Submit API

`POST /api/authors/me/books/{bookId}/submit`

```json
{
  "fileUrl": "https://example.com/manuscript.pdf",
  "genre": "Fiction",
  "wordCount": 50000,
  "packageId": "<PUBLISH_PACKAGE_ID>"
}
```

Legacy `POST /api/publish-requests` also exists for publish request creation.

## 46. Publishing State Machine

| Book / PublishRequest signal | Frontend state |
| --- | --- |
| `Book.status=draft`, no active request | `DRAFT` |
| `PublishRequest.status=PENDING` | `SUBMITTED` |
| `UNDER_REVIEW` | `UNDER_REVIEW` |
| `CHANGES_REQUESTED` | `CHANGES_REQUESTED` |
| `REJECTED` | `REJECTED` |
| `APPROVED` + book published | `PUBLISHED` |
| `Book.status=archived` | `ARCHIVED` |

## 47. Changes Requested Flow

Admin sends a reason. Author sees the feedback, edits the draft/manuscript, saves, and resubmits. Frontend should show the latest review reason and avoid creating multiple duplicate submissions.

## 48. Rejected Flow

Rejected submissions should show the rejection reason and lock the current request. Any reapply/resubmit behavior must follow the actual available author book/update routes and state returned by the backend.

## 49. Published Flow

Admin approval publishes the linked book. Public catalog should rely on backend book listing/detail visibility and not expose draft/manuscript fields.

## 50. Dashboard Access Overview

Paid author dashboard access is separate from author publishing. States include no plan/purchase, payment pending, verification pending, active, and revoked.

## 51. Dashboard Access State API

`GET /api/authors/me/dashboard-access` returns current author dashboard entitlement, active plan, and purchase/payment status where available.

## 52. Dashboard Access State Machine

| State | UI |
| --- | --- |
| `NOT_AUTHOR` | Hide dashboard purchase. |
| `APPROVED_AUTHOR_NO_PLAN` | Show purchase CTA if plan exists. |
| `PAYMENT_PENDING` | Show QR/payment instructions. |
| `VERIFICATION_PENDING` | Show waiting for admin verification. |
| `ACTIVE` | Unlock dashboard. |
| `REVOKED` | Lock dashboard and show support/admin message. |

## 53. Dashboard Plan

Admin controls plan amount and status. Frontend should display returned plan data. Do not send amount/currency from author purchase UI.

## 54. Purchase Dashboard Access

`POST /api/authors/me/dashboard-access/purchase` requires no body. Backend snapshots active plan and creates an `AUTHOR_ACCESS` payment/purchase.

## 55. Dashboard Payment Flow

```text
Author -> Purchase dashboard plan -> QR/payment pending -> Submit UTR -> Admin verification -> ACTIVE entitlement
```

Submit UTR:

```http
PUT /api/authors/me/dashboard-access/purchases/<PURCHASE_ID>/verify-payment
```

```json
{ "utr": "UTR123456789" }
```

## 56. Dashboard Server-Owned Fields

Frontend cannot control `amount`, `currency`, `purpose`, `subjectType`, `subjectId`, entitlement status, plan status, or access dates.

## 57. Dashboard Access Error Handling

Handle `AUTHOR_DASHBOARD_ACCESS_REQUIRED` by showing purchase/pending state. Handle revoked access separately from unpaid/no-plan. Publishing screens should remain available to authors even when dashboard access is not active.

## 58. Dashboard Summary API

`GET /api/authors/me/dashboard` returns summary metrics for the authenticated entitled author. Admin can inspect author-specific dashboards through admin author endpoints.

## 59. Dashboard Metric Definitions

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `publishedBooks` | Count of currently published author books. |
| `draftBooks` | Count of author drafts. |
| `unitsSold` | Units sold for author books. |
| `grossBookRevenue` | Gross revenue from author book lines. |
| `accruedKnown` / `accrued` | Known accrued royalty. |
| `eligibleUnsettled` | Royalty eligible for settlement but not yet claimed. |
| `settledPendingPayment` | Settled amount not yet marked paid. |
| `paidLifetime` | Lifetime paid payout amount. |

## 60. Royalty Terminology

- Accrued: royalty generated by sales.
- Eligible: accrued royalty that can be included in settlement.
- Settled: included in a settlement batch.
- Paid: manually transferred externally and recorded in HM Backend.

## 61. Analytics API

`GET /api/authors/me/analytics?range=30d&from=<ISO>&to=<ISO>` returns author sales/royalty time-series. Use `range` presets where supported; use `from`/`to` for custom date windows.

## 62. Book Performance

`GET /api/authors/me/books/performance` returns per-book performance. The route is intentionally ordered before `/api/authors/me/books/{bookId}` so `performance` is not treated as a book ID.

## 63. Royalty History

`GET /api/authors/me/royalties?page=1&limit=10&bookId=<BOOK_ID>&from=<ISO>&to=<ISO>`

Use pagination, book filters, and date filters for royalty history screens.

## 64. Historical Royalty Integrity

New order items snapshot author and royalty percentage at purchase time. Legacy lines without snapshots may be marked as `HISTORICAL_RATE_UNAVAILABLE` and excluded from settlement eligibility.

## 65. ZERO vs UNKNOWN

`royaltyAmount = 0` means known zero. `royaltyAmount = null` means unknown historical rate. Frontend must not render `null` as zero.

## 66. Partial Data UX

If `dataStatus = PARTIAL`, show a banner explaining that historical sales without royalty snapshots are excluded or unresolved.

## 67. Author Settlement APIs

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/authors/me/royalty-settlements` | List own settlements. |
| `GET /api/authors/me/royalty-settlements/{id}` | Own settlement detail. |

## 68. Settlement Object

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `_id` | Settlement ID. |
| `author` | Author/user. |
| `status` | Draft/approved/paid/cancelled style state. |
| `amount` / totals | Server-calculated settlement amount. |
| `claims` | Source royalty lines included. |
| `payout` | Manual payout record when paid. |
| `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | Audit timestamps. |

## 69. Settlement States

Frontend should model states as draft/pending admin action, approved/payment pending, paid, and cancelled according to returned backend status.

## 70. Author Settlement UX

Authors can view settlement list/detail. Authors cannot set payout amounts or mark paid. Paid status means admin recorded an external manual transfer.

## 71. Admin Panel Architecture

Recommended admin sections with APIs: Dashboard, Users, Author Applications, Authors, Author Access, Books, Publishing Queue, Orders, Payments, Invoices, Shipments, Royalty Settlements, Content, Categories, Reviews, Analytics, Notifications, Inventory/Ledgers.

## 72. Admin Authentication + Authorization

All `/api/admin/*` routes require bearer auth and admin role via middleware. UI hiding is convenience only; backend authorization is authoritative.

## 73. Admin Dashboard API

Use `GET /api/admin/dashboard`, `GET /api/admin/operations/dashboard`, `GET /api/admin/analytics`, `GET /api/admin/stats`, and `GET /api/admin/analytics/dashboard` for cards and operational summaries.

## 74. Admin Dashboard UI Implementation

Create cards for pending payments, pending author applications, pending publish requests, low stock, shipments, revenue, and settlement queues. Link each card to the relevant list page using the endpoint table.

## 75. Admin Users

| API | Purpose | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/admin/users` | List users | Query `page`, `limit`, `role`, `isActive`, `search` |
| `GET /api/admin/users/{id}` | User detail | No body |
| `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}` | Partial update | `AdminUserUpdateRequest` |
| `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/role` | Update role | `UserRoleRequest` |
| `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/role` | Role alias | `UserRoleRequest` |
| `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/status` | Update active flag | `UserStatusRequest` |
| `POST /api/admin/users/{id}/reset-password` | Reset password | `ResetPasswordRequest` |

Compatibility: `role=user` -> `reader`; `status=Active` -> `isActive=true`; `status=Suspended` -> `isActive=false`.

## 76. Admin Author Applications

`GET /api/admin/author-applications?status=pending` and `PUT /api/admin/author-applications/{id}/status`. Approving an application updates associated user role to `author`.

## 77. Admin Authors

Use `GET /api/admin/authors/{authorId}`, `GET /api/admin/authors/{authorId}/dashboard`, and `GET /api/admin/authors/{authorId}/royalties` for aggregate admin author pages.

## 78. Admin Author Access Plans

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/admin/author-access/plans` | List plans |
| `POST /api/admin/author-access/plans` | Create plan |
| `PUT /api/admin/author-access/plans/{id}` | Update plan |
| `POST /api/admin/author-access/plans/{id}/activate` | Activate plan |
| `POST /api/admin/author-access/plans/{id}/archive` | Archive plan |

Typical plan payload:

```json
{
  "name": "Author Pro Dashboard",
  "description": "One-time dashboard access",
  "amount": 2999,
  "currency": "INR",
  "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

## 79. Admin Author Access Purchases

Use `GET /api/admin/author-access/purchases` for purchases and `GET /api/admin/author-access/entitlements` for entitlement state. Payment verification still uses the admin operations payment endpoints.

## 80. Manual Grant/Revoke/Restore

| API | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/admin/author-access/entitlements/grant` | `{ "userId": "<AUTHOR_ID>", "reason": "Manual admin grant" }` |
| `POST /api/admin/author-access/entitlements/{userId}/revoke` | `{ "reason": "Admin decision" }` |
| `POST /api/admin/author-access/entitlements/{userId}/restore` | `{ "reason": "Admin decision" }` |

## 81. Admin Payment Verification

Use `GET /api/admin/operations/payments` and detail/action endpoints. Always display payment `purpose`: `ORDER_PURCHASE` or `AUTHOR_ACCESS`.

## 82. Admin Payment Queue Object

Queue rows should include payment ID, order if present, user/customer, amount, currency, provider/method, status, purpose, UTR masked/reference, created/submitted dates, and verification metadata when returned.

## 83. Approve Payment

`POST /api/admin/operations/payments/{id}/approve`

```json
{ "reason": "Verified in bank statement" }
```

Approval may trigger order compatibility sync, invoice/shipment/notification/analytics side effects for order purchases, or author entitlement for author access.

## 84. Reject Payment

`POST /api/admin/operations/payments/{id}/reject`

```json
{ "reason": "UTR not found" }
```

Refresh queues after rejection.

## 85. Admin Publishing Queue

Use `GET /api/admin/publish-requests`, `PUT /api/admin/publish-requests/{id}/status`, and explicit action routes for request changes, reject, and approve.

## 86. Request Changes

`POST /api/admin/publish-requests/{id}/request-changes`

```json
{ "reason": "Please update chapter 2 and upload a revised manuscript." }
```

## 87. Reject Publishing Request

`POST /api/admin/publish-requests/{id}/reject`

```json
{ "reason": "Submission does not meet editorial policy." }
```

## 88. Approve Publishing Request

`POST /api/admin/publish-requests/{id}/approve`

```json
{ "notes": "Approved for publishing." }
```

Approval publishes the existing linked book.

## 89. Admin Book Management

Actual routes are `POST /api/admin/books`, `PUT /api/admin/books/{id}`, and `DELETE /api/admin/books/{id}`. Public book CRUD is not exposed.

## 90. Admin Book Form Fields

Admin may set title, description, author, category, mrp/price, royaltyPercentage, coverImage, stock, reservedStock, status, discountPrice, bestseller/featured/newRelease flags, isbn, pages, and format according to schema. Server owns slug generation and calculated review/rating fields.

## 91. Admin Orders

`GET /api/admin/orders` lists orders. `PUT /api/admin/orders/{id}/status` accepts `StatusUpdateRequest`. Frontend compatibility may send title-case statuses that the service normalizes.

## 92. Admin Invoices

Use list/search/detail/download APIs under `/api/admin/invoices`. Download endpoint returns a document response; use browser download handling.

## 93. Admin Shipments

Use `GET /api/admin/shipments`, search, detail, tracking, assign courier, update status, and cancel. Courier assignment payload is documented in `CourierAssignRequest`.

## 94. Settlement Accounting Overview

```text
Accrued royalty -> eligible royalty -> draft settlement -> approved settlement -> external manual transfer -> mark paid
```

## 95. Settlement Eligibility

Only known, eligible, unsettled royalty source lines should be included. Legacy unknown lines are excluded until resolved.

## 96. Settlement Preview

`POST /api/admin/royalty-settlements/preview` previews settlement candidates. Use returned server totals; do not calculate payable totals in the frontend as authority.

## 97. Create Settlement

`POST /api/admin/royalty-settlements` creates a draft settlement batch from eligible source lines. Payload schema is `SettlementCreateRequest` where documented by OpenAPI/generated docs.

## 98. Approve Settlement

`POST /api/admin/royalty-settlements/{id}/approve` approves a draft settlement. If source lines were already claimed, backend may return `409`.

## 99. Double-Settlement Protection

`RoyaltySettlementClaim.royaltySourceKey` protects each royalty source line from being claimed twice. A `409` means the admin should refresh/re-preview.

## 100. Cancel Settlement

`POST /api/admin/royalty-settlements/{id}/cancel`

```json
{ "reason": "Created by mistake" }
```

Only valid states can be cancelled.

## 101. Manual Payout

HM Backend does not automatically transfer money. Admin transfers externally through the chosen banking/payment channel and then records payment in HM Backend.

## 102. Mark Paid API

`POST /api/admin/royalty-settlements/{id}/mark-paid`

```json
{
  "paymentMethod": "bank_transfer",
  "transactionReference": "<TRANSACTION_REFERENCE>",
  "notes": "Paid externally",
  "paidAt": "2026-08-09T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## 103. Server-Owned Payout Amount

Frontend does not send trusted payout amount. Backend settlement amount is authoritative.

## 104. Duplicate Mark-Paid

Duplicate mark-paid attempts should be treated as conflict/already-paid behavior. Refresh settlement detail before showing another action.

## 109.1 Critical Response Examples

Response envelopes below are representative of the current controllers. Some populated subdocuments vary by query/controller path.

```json
{ "success": true, "token": "jwt", "refreshToken": "refresh", "user": { "_id": "userId", "name": "Reader", "email": "reader@example.com", "role": "reader" } }
```

`POST /api/auth/register` and `POST /api/auth/login` return auth tokens and a user. Public register always returns `role: "reader"` even if a legacy client sends a role field.

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "user": { "id": "userId", "_id": "userId", "role": "author", "isActive": true }, "capabilities": { "canPublish": true, "canAccessAuthorDashboard": false, "canAdminister": false }, "states": { "authorApplicationStatus": "APPROVED", "dashboardAccessStatus": "NOT_PURCHASED", "publishingStatus": "APPROVED" } } }
```

`GET /api/users/me/context` uses `NOT_PURCHASED` for an approved author with no dashboard entitlement/purchase. `GET /api/authors/me/dashboard-access` uses `APPROVED_AUTHOR_NO_PLAN` for the same paywall condition. Treat them as equivalent frontend UI states but do not send either as a backend enum.

```json
{ "success": true, "data": [{ "_id": "bookId", "title": "Book", "slug": "book", "mrp": 499, "price": 499, "status": "published" }], "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 10, "total": 1 } }
```

Catalog list responses return arrays plus pagination. Public book detail returns one `Book` object by slug; related and reviews return arrays.

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "order": { "_id": "orderId", "orderNumber": "HM-ABC123", "isPaid": false, "paymentMethod": "UPI" }, "payment": { "_id": "paymentId", "status": "QR_GENERATED", "purpose": "ORDER_PURCHASE", "amount": 499 }, "qrCodeDataUrl": "data:image/png;base64,..." } }
```

`POST /api/orders` creates order/payment/reservation behind the scenes. Frontend must use server-returned totals and QR data.

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "payment": { "_id": "paymentId", "status": "VERIFICATION_PENDING", "utr": "masked" }, "order": { "_id": "orderId", "isPaid": false, "utr": "UPI1234567890" } } }
```

`PUT /api/orders/{id}/verify-payment` submits UTR and waits for admin verification.

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "author": true, "dashboardAccess": { "status": "ACTIVE", "hasAccess": true, "source": "PURCHASE" } } }
```

Author dashboard access, dashboard, analytics, book performance, royalty history, and settlement endpoints use the standard `{ success, data, pagination? }` envelope.

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "summary": {}, "queues": {}, "recentActivity": [] } }
```

Admin dashboard and operations endpoints return optimized summary/list/detail DTOs. Admin payment queues, publish requests, and royalty settlements return arrays/details plus pagination where supported.

## 109.2 Persisted vs Frontend-Derived States

| Domain | Backend persisted/returned value | Frontend derived value | UI meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payment | `PAYMENT_PENDING`, `PAYMENT_SUBMITTED`, `VERIFICATION_PENDING` | `awaitingUserOrAdminAction` | Show UTR form or pending verification. |
| Payment | `PAYMENT_VERIFIED` | `paid` | Unlock order/invoice/shipment side effects. |
| Payment | `PAYMENT_REJECTED`, `PAYMENT_FAILED`, `PAYMENT_EXPIRED`, `PAYMENT_CANCELLED` | `recoverableOrClosedFailure` | Show retry/new attempt support depending on screen. |
| Publishing | `PENDING`, `UNDER_REVIEW` | `inReview` | Lock draft editing and show review progress. |
| Publishing | `CHANGES_REQUESTED` | `needsAuthorChanges` | Allow author to update and resubmit. |
| Publishing | `APPROVED` | `published` | Book may be public depending on book status. |
| Dashboard Access | `ACTIVE` | `dashboardUnlocked` | Allow author dashboard. |
| Dashboard Access | `REVOKED` | `accessRevoked` | Show support/admin message. |
| Dashboard Access | `PAYMENT_PENDING`, `VERIFICATION_PENDING` | `purchaseInProgress` | Show payment/verification status. |
| Dashboard Access | `APPROVED_AUTHOR_NO_PLAN` or user-context `NOT_PURCHASED` | `showPaywall` | Approved author can buy dashboard access. |
| Settlement | `DRAFT`, `READY_FOR_APPROVAL` | `needsAdminReview` | Admin can approve/cancel. |
| Settlement | `APPROVED`, `PAYMENT_PENDING` | `awaitingManualPayout` | Admin must transfer externally and mark paid. |
| Settlement | `PAID` | `paid` | Author can view paid record. |
| Order | Existing order status values | `orderProgress` | Use backend value for display; do not infer payment from order alone. |

## 115.1 Server-Owned Fields Matrix

| Domain | Field | Client can send? | Server authoritative? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Order | `items[].book`, `items[].quantity` | Yes | Partly | Client chooses items; server validates stock, book, and pricing. |
| Order | `subtotal`, `tax`, `shipping`, `total` | No | Yes | Prevents client-side price/tax tampering. |
| Order | `orderNumber`, `status`, `isPaid`, `paidAt` | No | Yes | Lifecycle and compatibility fields are controlled by backend. |
| Payment | `utr` | Yes | Partly | Customer/admin submits reference; backend validates uniqueness/state. |
| Payment | `amount`, `currency`, `purpose`, `subjectId`, `status` | No | Yes | Payment intent and state machine are backend-owned. |
| AuthorAccessPurchase | `purchaseId` path, `utr` | Yes | Partly | User submits UTR for a server-created purchase. |
| AuthorAccessPurchase | `amount`, `planVersion`, `status`, `paidAt` | No | Yes | Plan snapshot and entitlement lifecycle are backend-owned. |
| AuthorBook | `title`, `description`, `category`, `mrp`, `coverImage`, `format`, `isbn`, `pages` | Yes | Partly | Author can edit only allowlisted draft fields. |
| AuthorBook | `author`, `slug`, `status`, `royaltyPercentage`, `stock`, `reservedStock`, merchandising flags | No | Yes | Identity, publishing, inventory, and commercial controls are protected. |
| AdminBook | `mrp`, `stock`, `status`, `royaltyPercentage` | Yes | Partly | Admin can submit, backend validates and normalizes. |
| AdminBook | `slug`, ratings/review counts, historical royalty snapshots | No | Yes | Derived or historical values cannot be client-owned. |
| Settlement | `authorId`, `periodStart`, `periodEnd` | Yes | Partly | Admin selects scope; backend computes eligible lines. |
| Settlement | `grossBookRevenue`, `totalRoyalty`, `itemCount`, `items`, `status` | No | Yes | Financial audit values are calculated and protected. |
| Payout | `paymentMethod`, `transactionReference`, `paidAt`, `notes` | Yes | Partly | Admin records external manual payout details. |
| Payout | `amount`, `currency`, `settlement`, `author`, `status` | No | Yes | Payout amount comes from approved settlement only. |

## 116. State Management Recommendations

Store auth token/session, user context, cart, active order/payment, author publishing filters, dashboard access status, author dashboard filters, and admin filters separately. Do not store server-owned money as editable client state.

## 117. Loading / Empty / Error UX Matrix

| Feature | Loading | Empty | Error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog | Skeleton grid | No books found | Retry/search reset |
| Orders | List skeleton | No orders yet | Retry/account support |
| Payment | Disable submit | No active payment | Refresh/order detail |
| Author application | Status skeleton | Show form | Retry/login |
| Author dashboard | Metric skeleton | No sales yet | Paywall/refresh |
| Admin queues | Table skeleton | No pending work | Retry/show error |

## 118. Retry Guidance

Safe retries: GET list/detail, refresh context, refresh payment detail, download retry, search retry. Dangerous duplicate operations: order creation, UTR submit, book submit, admin approve/reject, settlement approve/mark paid. Use disabled buttons and confirmation dialogs.

## 119. Idempotency Guidance

Frontend should disable double-submit for order payment UTR, author access UTR, book submit, admin payment approval, publishing approval, settlement approval, and mark paid. Backend has protections, but UX should avoid duplicate requests.

## 120. Frontend Security Rules

Never trust client permissions, never expose admin controls solely through UI checks, never log JWT, never log full UTR, never expose secrets, never trust client money, never expose manuscript URLs publicly, never allow role escalation from public forms.

## 121. Sensitive Fields

Sensitive fields include JWT/refresh tokens, password reset tokens, full UTR, provider payloads, secrets, manuscript document URLs before publication, admin-only book fields, settlement payout details, and internal audit metadata.

## 122. IDOR Expectations

Backend enforces ownership, but frontend should still scope user routes to the current user from context and not construct routes for another user's private resources.

## 123. Frontend Integration Test Checklist

Customer: login, catalog, book detail, cart, order create, UTR submit, payment pending, invoice, tracking, notification, wishlist. Author: application, approval, draft, upload, submit, dashboard purchase, dashboard metrics, royalty history, settlement detail. Admin: author approval, payment approval/rejection, publishing moderation, user updates, content updates, shipment actions, settlement payout.

## 124. Error Test Checklist

Test 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 413, 415, 422, 500, and 503 paths where relevant.

## 125. Role Test Matrix

Test reader, author without plan, author with active plan, author with revoked access, and admin. Verify backend rejects unauthorized calls even if UI hides buttons.

## 126. Payment Test Matrix

Test `ORDER_PURCHASE` and `AUTHOR_ACCESS` separately. Verify order purchase creates order side effects and author access activates entitlement without invoice/shipment/order side effects.

## 127. Publishing Test Matrix

Test ownership, draft edit, forbidden fields, upload config failures, submit, request changes, reject, approve, and public catalog visibility.

## 128. Royalty Test Matrix

Test known royalty, zero royalty, historical unavailable/null royalty, settlement preview, duplicate claim conflict, approve, cancel, and mark paid.

## 129. Frontend Environment Checklist

Browser-safe variables only: API base URL, public app URL, feature flags, analytics public keys if used. Never ship Mongo URI, JWT secret, Cloudinary secret, email credentials, or payment secrets to frontend.

## 130. Backend Deployment Assumptions

Production certification passed for code and regression. Deployment is conditional on target-database dry-run audits, migration apply where needed, and secret review. `.env` contains local credentials and is ignored by Git; do not commit or paste secrets.

## 131. Manual Payout Operations

Admin SOP: review eligible royalty -> preview settlement -> create draft -> approve -> transfer externally -> record transaction reference with mark-paid -> author sees paid settlement.

## 132. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 after login | Token missing/expired | Refresh once or login. |
| 403 author dashboard | No active entitlement or revoked | Show dashboard access state. |
| Book performance 404 | Old deployment route order | Deploy latest route ordering. |
| Payment pending forever | UTR not approved yet | Admin verify payment. |
| UTR rejected | Invalid/duplicate/not found | Ask user to recheck/support. |
| Upload failure | Cloudinary config, MIME, or size | Show specific error. |
| Settlement conflict | Duplicate source claim | Refresh preview/list. |
| Royalty null | Historical rate unavailable | Show unknown, not zero. |

## 133. FAQ

**Why can an author publish without dashboard plan?** Publishing is tied to author role. Paid dashboard controls analytics/royalty dashboard only.

**Why does royalty show null?** Some historical lines lack purchase-time royalty snapshots. Null means unknown, not zero.

**Why is MRP different from legacy price?** `mrp` is canonical; `price` remains compatibility.

**Why does AUTHOR_ACCESS not create invoice/shipment?** It is not an order purchase and should not trigger order side effects.

**Why does settlement return 409?** A royalty source line was already claimed or state changed; refresh.

**Why can't frontend send payment amount?** Backend owns financial calculation to prevent tampering.

**Why is payout manual?** Automatic payout provider is intentionally not implemented in v1; admin records external transfer.
